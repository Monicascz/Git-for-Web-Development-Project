Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
   Inline are in line and fill the space needed without a break. Block elements start on a new line and takes up the full width available. 
   
   2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
   It means that it's position is fixed and it does not move in the regular layout.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    display: flex;

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    Button, Address, li 

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    There is content at the center of everything we do, that is usually the HTML, or the foundation. When we add CSS, we have the ability to manipulate the space around our foundation.
    The order in which we manipulate space around our foundation is padding, (outlined by border), then margin.
